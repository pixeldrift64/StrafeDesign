# Strafe Design - by James Mayell
## A Bootstrap based template using jQuery and SASS

The technologies used in creating this design were HTML, SCSS, JS and Git for source control.
The main css file was compiled using two SCSS files, and the layout is fully responsive, working natively on both desktop and mobile devices. Using the Bootstrap column layout as a base, I was able to create this template with ease using some custom JS and a lot of SCSS markup.
